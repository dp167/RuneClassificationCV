# RuneClassificationCV
Using Computer Vision to build a image classifier that can classify Rune tiles, for CS410p At PSU

MVP:

for this project includes the ability to generate a data set from smartphone photos taken of runes and be able to classify 12 specific runes via a file of testing images with an accuracy of at least 70%.

Reach goals:
  1. produce bounding boxes around particular runes in an image of multiple runes with each rune labled correctly
  
  2. Deploy mobile application to allow for real time classification of runes including the applicatio of goal 1.
  
  2.a. add features to estimate rune distance and output the possible meaning of the rune formations
  

Milestones:
     
     02/20 Code finished for MVP - Images are processable and CNN able to give a preliminary result 
       
       02/27 Code Debugged begin writting a report on the efficency of methods.. Begin reach goals
       
       03/10 - presentation of final product due 
        
        03/15 final submission due
